Big Data:
Data types:  Structured ==> excel, sql, tables.
Semi structured ==> XML, json files
unstructured data ==> logs generated by servers. 80% of data in the world is unstructured.
big data:
5 V:  1) Volume: very big volume, in Terabytes, Zettabytes, etc.
2) Velocity: (????) : the speed of data being generated or moving around
3) Variety: so many diffrerent types of data
4) Velocity: accuracy => data preparation in traditional structured data causes inaccurcy sometimes, but in big data technologies we can deal with unstructured data to keep the accuracy.
5) Value: we need to find use cases for big data first so that we can turn it into value before starting to collect data. 70% of big data projects fail becuase of not understanding the big data.

2 important concepts in Hadoop:
       ---) HDFS (storage engine)
      ---) MapReduce (daa processing engine)
